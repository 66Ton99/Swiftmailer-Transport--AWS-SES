	write(â€¦) will be invoked repeatedly on the byte stream object until all bytes 
	contained in the message have been written.  The SMTP transport takes this 
	approach.  The biggest hurdle for you here appears to be that you need to 
	base64 encode the MIME data that will be streamed.  That would mean you'd 
	need to encode a number of bytes cleanly divisible by 3, buffering anything 
	left over, otherwise the result would be invalid (there'd be "=" characters in
	the middle of the base64-encoded content, instead of only at the end).  You'd
	have to manually call flushBuffers() on the stream after invoked toByteStream() 
	on the message in order to prevent any buffered bytes from being left in the stream.
